How It Works
Keep in mind that this program uses not integer values but rather string
values that contain numeric digits. For example, '426' is a different value
than 426. We need to do this because we are performing string comparisons
with the secret number, not math operations. Remember that '0' can be
a leading digit: the string '026' is different from '26', but the integer 026 is
the same as 26.

Bagels, a deductive logic game.

I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say: That means:
Pico One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
Fermi One digit is correct and in the right position.
Bagels No digit is correct.
I have thought up a number.
You have 10 guesses to get it.
Guess #1:
> 123
Pico
Guess #2:
> 456
Bagels
Guess #3:
> 178
Pico Pico
--snip--
Guess #7:
> 791
Fermi Fermi
Guess #8:
> 701
You got it!
